This does it perfectly every time.

You'll need these equipment:

* Cooker

  (Induction cooker works best. Gas cookers warm up the water too slowly, causing the eggs to
  totally overcook.)

* Thermometer

  (preferably with long measuring tip, the kind you stick into turkey)

* Timer

* Thermal pot, with lid

  (Or any super-insulated container with lid)

* Big plastic spoon

  (Should be about large enough to hold 1 egg comfortably.)


Steps:

1. Put eggs into a pot, cover eggs completely with water.

1. Heat water to 60째C. Turn off your cooker.

1. Let stand for 5 minutes.

   (This step warms the eggs' insides, so heat transfer later is more efficient and doesn't overcook
   outer layer of egg whites.

1. Set timer to count down for 2.5 minutes. (Don't start it yet)

1. Heat water 84째C. Start timer! **Keep water at 84째C for 2.5 minutes!**

   This step actually cooks the eggs. Eggs actually get cooked at 67째C, but our higher temperature
   means you don't have to stand around for 1 hour to wait for the eggs to cook.

   You'll *very likely* have to juggle the heat control of your cooker to maintain that temperature.

1. At the end of 2.5 minutes...

   This step has to be fast, obviously, since you want to retain the heat in the eggs. The rest of
   the cooking will be done in the thermal pot.

   Scooping out the eggs fast will mean bringing in some water into the thermal pot. Simply drain
   that water away.

   a. *Quickly* use the plastic spoon to transfer eggs into thermal pot.

   b. Put the lid on the pot's opening, and drain all water brought into the pot by the spoon.

   c. Ensure all eggs are laid out in single layer. (My thermal pot has a 2-tiered container, great
   for 8 eggs in total.)

   d. Seal the thermal pot.

1. Let stand for 15 minutes.

   This is where the eggs will continue cooking with *diminishing temperature*, which gives it very
   lenient margin for error at this step. You can even let stand for 30 minutes or more, and the
   eggs will still turn out fine.
